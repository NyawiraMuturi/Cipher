# Project Title
This is a Ceaser-Cipher project. The idea is to allow the user of the application to encrypt a message and for the one recieving it to decrypt it. 

## Getting Started
Using the terminal, the User is presented with options one whether they want their messages encrypted or decrypted. Once the user makes a choice they get an output based on the messages they key in. 

## Running the tests

There are tests that have been run to ensure that the application works in multiple scenarios.


### Technologies
This application has come to life using Intellij and it's inbuild features such as Gradle.


## Contributing
